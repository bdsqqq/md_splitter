# md_splitter

I made this to split some translations of a book into individual files for each chapter. The code is really simple so tinker with it to fit your needs.

## Running locally

clone this repo and run `go run . <your_md_file.md>`, an `out/` folder should be generated at the project folder.

## Creating a production build

Clone this repo and run `go build .`, you should get a binary for your operating system.

# Other stuff

Before this I never wrote a line of golang so yeah, probably a lot of mistakes. Also, see [me getting overly happy while building this](https://twitter.com/bedesqui/status/1557388112032137218?s=20&t=qhFfeafr4qF7hr3XQfnDHg) after [choosing golang for no reason at all](https://twitter.com/bedesqui/status/1557223170272333824?s=20&t=qhFfeafr4qF7hr3XQfnDHg).
